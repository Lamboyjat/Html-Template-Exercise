Xanda HTML Evaluation
=====================

We would like you to create a functioning HTML page so it matches the Home Page design layout JPEG contained within 
the Evaluation Instructions directory. 

All assets have already been cut-up and provided in the various Assets directories.
 
We want to see how you build the page, so please do not use any CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation.
 
Please use HTML5 (W3C compliant), SASS and JavaScript. If you are not comfortable with SASS then CSS is fine.
 
The page should function and resemble the creative in the following web browsers:
•         Chrome (latest)
•         Firefox (latest)
•         Safari (latest)
•         IE 9+
 
Please ensure your code is neat and tidy and any unused code should be removed. 

Please spend no longer than 8 hours on this evaluation, and return all source code for evaluation in the Returned
Evaluation Code directory within the ZIP file to enquiries@xanda.net

Further instructions on the returned code requirements can be found in the Returned Evaluation Code directory.
 
Good luck with the trial. We are looking forward to seeing your work.

Should you have any questions or require further guidance, please contact Talib at talib@xanda.net.
